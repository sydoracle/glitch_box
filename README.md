# SendGrid Quick Start
This app implents SendGrid's [Quick Start app for Node.js](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs#quick-start). It's the minimum needed code to send an email using SendGrid.

## To Get Started
[Remix this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/sendgrid-quickstart) and add your SendGrid API key in the `.env` file in your Glitch project. Be sure to change the `toEmail` value to an address you have access to.
